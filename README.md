# Sudoku-Solve-Visualizer-2.0
Overview

The Sudoku Solver Visualization project is a Java-based application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for solving Sudoku puzzles interactively. It employs a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles entered by the user or generated randomly. The application offers visual feedback on the correctness of entries and dynamically updates the grid to reflect the solving process.
Features

    Interactive Sudoku Grid: Enter Sudoku puzzles manually or generate random boards.
    Real-Time Feedback: Visual cues (color-coded cells) indicate correct and incorrect entries.
    Solver Integration: Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.
    User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls for solving, clearing the board, and generating new puzzles.

Technology Stack

    Programming Language: Java
    Framework: Swing for GUI development
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IntelliJ IDEA

Usage

    Run the Application: Compile and run the Main.java file to start the Sudoku Solver Visualization.

    Input Sudoku Puzzles: Enter numbers into the grid manually or click "Random Board" to generate a random Sudoku puzzle.

    Solve Puzzles: Click the "Solve" button to initiate the solving process. Watch as the grid updates in real-time to reflect the solver's progress.

    Clear the Board: Use the "Clear" button to reset the grid and start fresh.

Installation
